# Task 4 - DevOps Git Project

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on implementing Git best practices to manage a DevOps project. It involves creating and managing a Git repository, using branches for development, and collaborating through pull requests. The goal is to demonstrate version control and project management techniques in a DevOps environment.

## Tools Used:
- **Git**: For version control.
- **GitHub**: For hosting the repository and collaborating on the project.

## Steps Taken:
1. **Repository Initialization**: A new Git repository was created and pushed to GitHub.
2. **Branching**: Three main branches were created: `dev`, `feature`, and `main`.
3. **Pull Requests**: Changes from the feature branch were merged into the dev branch using pull requests.
4. **Tagging**: A tag (`v1.0`) was created for the initial release.
5. **Project Documentation**: The project was documented with a `README.md` file to explain the steps and structure.

## Conclusion:
The project was successfully set up and managed using Git best practices. Branching, pull requests, and tagging were used to ensure a smooth workflow and proper version control.
